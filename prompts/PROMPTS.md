# Prompts Used in This Study

This is a rendered, human-readable view of the exact prompts used in the published study this repository accompanies (climate finance policy classification). It is generated directly from [`prompts_example.py`](prompts_example.py) and [`judge_prompts.py`](judge_prompts.py) by [`render_prompts.py`](render_prompts.py), so it cannot drift out of sync with the actual prompt source -- if you edit either source file, re-run `python prompts/render_prompts.py` to regenerate this doc.

**These are provided as a guide and source of inspiration for prompt design, not as a generic, plug-and-play template.** If you are adapting this framework for a different classification task, you will need to write your own prompts tailored to your own taxonomy and research questions.

Placeholders like `<INSTRUMENT_SUMMARY>` mark where per-document content (document summaries, retrieved chunks, few-shot examples) is substituted in at runtime -- everything else is the fixed instruction text/schema actually sent to the model.

## System prompts

### Summarization system prompt

```
You are a domain expert in climate finance policy classification. However, you refuse to provide any categorizations. You are an expert in summarizing and providing context. You never allude to categorizations, and, in fact, if you do, you will be fired as that is someone else's job.

Use the detailed taxonomy, definitions, and classification criteria embedded in your training data to provide accurate and precise answers grounded in your expert knowledge of climate finance instruments, regulatory frameworks, and financial sector impact.

Focus on consistency, clarity, and completeness in your response. Your answers will be combined with question-specific user prompts providing precise tasks and guiding the output format.

Treat each question independently based on the context provided in the prompt, leveraging your understanding of climate finance policy instruments, their targets, incentives, market failures addressed, and other relevant aspects.

Avoid adding extraneous explanations unless explicitly asked. Your response should reflect the specialized knowledge embedded within climate finance regulation and classification best practices.
```

### Classification system prompt

```
You are a domain expert in climate finance policy classification. You will be given a climate finance policy instrument and a summary of the instrument. You will need to categorize the instrument based on the context provided in the prompt. IF YOU CHOOSE AN INSTRUMENT NOT PROVIDED IN THE JSON YOU WILL BE GIVEN PER QUESTION, YOU WILL BE FIRED. DO NOT MAKE UP ANY OF YOUR OWN CATEGORIES.

Use the detailed taxonomy, definitions, and classification criteria embedded in your training data to provide accurate and precise answers grounded in your expert knowledge of climate finance instruments, regulatory frameworks, and financial sector impact.

Please provide concise answers, following the examples provided. We do not need justifications or explanations.

## Summarization prompts

Generated per document via `get_all_prompts(doc_text)`, one per focus area, using `summarizing_prompt()`:

### Sectoral focus (question 2)

```

### Question 3 -- subject of intervention

Short form: For the following climate finance policy instrument, categorize the policy instrument’s subject of intervention. If there are many subjects, list all of them.

```
For the following climate finance policy instrument, categorize the policy instrument's subject(s) of intervention. If there are many subjects, list all of them. Base your classification on the table provided below.

Here are the steps to follow when making this assessment:

Step 1 — Check if a new organization is created

Determine whether the policy creates a new, legally distinct organization with its own governance structure, mandate, or budget (e.g., a sovereign fund, public investment bank, or new agency).
- If yes, classify that organization itself as a policy under the relevant Entity category (e.g., "Sovereign funds and investment-focused state-owned entities").
- If no — for example, the policy is a program administered directly by a ministry — do not classify the ministry itself as a new entity. Only classify the program’s products and beneficiaries.

Examples:
- New organization: The government creates an investment fund with its own board and management to invest in decarbonization projects → classify the fund as Entity: Sovereign funds and investment-focused state-owned entities.
- Program run by a ministry: The Ministry of Natural Resources launches a "Green Industry Loan Fund" program, but no new legal entity is created → do not classify the ministry as an entity; only classify the products (Loans) and beneficiaries (Non-financial corporations).

Step 2 — Classify internal policies and financial products

If an organization (new or existing) implements multiple financing instruments or initiatives, classify each distinct initiative as a separate policy.

Examples:
- Grants for R&D → Product: Grants
- Low-interest loans → Product: Debt instruments
- Equity investments in private firms → Product: Equity instruments
- Carbon contracts for difference → Product: Derivatives

Step 3 — Identify beneficiaries

Classify all entities that are subject to, benefit from, or are regulated by the policy.

Examples:
- Non-financial corporations receiving subsidies or loans → Entity: Non-financial corporations
- Insurers required to disclose climate-related risks → Entity: Insurers

### Question 4 -- market failure addressed

Short form: For the following climate finance policy instrument, categorize the market failure addressed. If there are many market failures, list all of them.

```
For the following climate finance policy instrument, categorize the market failure addressed. If there are many market failures, list all of them. Base your classification on Table provided below.

  Here is the table to help you categorize: 
  [{'category': 'Market failure', 'subject': 'Externalities', 'description': 'The policy aims to ensure that the price of a product or activity reflects its full social costs or benefits, including environmental and climate impacts.', 'examples': ['A carbon tax or emissions trading system that forces emitters to pay for greenhouse gas emissions.', 'A tax credit or subsidy that rewards activities with positive externalities, such as renewable energy or energy efficiency.'], 'question': 'Does the policy aim to internalize environmental or climate externalities by changing prices, costs, or incentives faced by private actors?'}, {'category': 'Market failure', 'subject': 'Public goods', 'description': 'The policy aims to support the creation, maintenance, or provision of assets that generate collective benefits and are non-excludable or non-rival (e.g., public infrastructure, research).', 'examples': ['Public investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, research and development, or education.', 'Subsidies for technologies or projects that have high social value but limited private profitability.'], 'question': 'Does the policy finance or incentivize the production of goods or services that benefit society as a whole, rather than only private actors?'}, {'category': 'Market failure', 'subject': 'Information asymmetry', 'description': 'The policy aims to improve access to, or understanding of, information relevant to climate or financial decisions, thereby reducing situations where one party (e.g., investors, consumers) knows less than another.', 'examples': ['Requirements for companies or investors to disclose climate-related risks or impacts.', 'Financial literacy programs for consumers or investors.'], 'question': 'Does the policy reduce information gaps between parties (e.g., investors and issuers, firms and consumers) about climate-related risks, impacts, or opportunities?'}, {'category': 'Market failure', 'subject': 'Coordination', 'description': 'The policy aims to facilitate cooperation or alignment among multiple actors whose independent actions must be coordinated to achieve an efficient outcome.', 'examples': ['The creation of sustainability taxonomies, labels, or certification systems.', 'Public support for shared or interoperable infrastructure (e.g., electric-vehicle charging networks, data standards).', 'Forums or institutions that help align investment standards or metrics.'], 'question': 'Does the policy promote standardization, interoperability, or shared practices that enable actors to coordinate their actions toward climate objectives?'}, {'category': 'Market failure', 'subject': 'Myopia', 'description': 'The policy aims to correct short-term biases in decision-making by encouraging or requiring consideration of long-term risks, costs, and opportunities.', 'examples': ['Rules requiring corporate directors to consider long-term climate risks.', 'Reforms that promote long-term investment horizons in financial markets.'], 'question': 'Does the policy encourage or require actors to account for long-term climate or financial risks and benefits, rather than focusing narrowly on short-term outcomes?'}, {'category': 'Market failure', 'subject': 'Missing markets', 'description': 'The policy aims to create or enable new markets for environmental goods or risks that were previously not traded or priced.', 'examples': ['Creation of a carbon market for emissions allowances.', 'Development of markets for resilience or catastrophe bonds.', 'Public programs that establish platforms for trading environmental attributes (e.g., offsets, certificates).'], 'question': 'Does the policy create or expand a market for environmental assets, risks, or services that previously had no market price?'}, {'category': 'Market failure', 'subject': 'Systemic risks', 'description': 'The policy aims to prevent the build-up or spread of risks that arise from the combined actions of multiple actors and could destabilize the economy or financial system.', 'examples': ['Prudential requirements for financial institutions to manage or limit exposure to climate-related risks.', 'Supervisory climate scenario analyses or stress tests.', 'Reforms to ensure financial stability amid large-scale climate shocks.'], 'question': 'Does the policy reduce the probability or severity of system-wide financial or economic instability caused by climate-related risks or shocks?'}]

  Remember: Classifying Climate Policies by Market Failure
 
Policies may sometimes address more than one type of market failure. In such cases, list all relevant market failures in order of priority, starting with the primary one.
 
Example:
A carbon tax addresses externalities by pricing the cost of pollution and also contributes to the preservation of a public good, namely a safe and stable climate.
 
Use the following guidance when classifying:
 
If the policy’s mechanism involves pricing, taxing, regulating, or limiting emissions, classify it primarily as “externalities"
 
If the policy’s mechanism involves funding collective mitigation or adaptation efforts, public R&D, or international cooperation, classify it as “public good.”

If both mechanisms apply, assign both labels. 

When in doubt, base the classification on the main causal mechanism through which the policy aims to correct market failures.

```
For the following climate finance policy instrument, categorize the type of incentive established. If there are many incentives, list all of them. Base your classification on the table provided below.

Keep in mind: When a government creates a new organization or imposes a new investment mandate or constraint on an existing one (e.g., a sovereign fund, public pension manager, or development bank) AND that entity implements one or several instruments, output two separate but linked classifications:

- Policy layer – classify the decision to create the entity as a policy in itself  
- Implementation layer – classify the tools that the entity will use to deliver on its mandate.  

Here is the table to help you categorize:

## Evaluation / judge prompts

Used to score classification responses against human-labeled ground truth. An exact string match (after normalizing case/whitespace) short-circuits this and scores 1.0 automatically without calling the judge.

### Judge system prompt

```
You are an expert evaluator for classification tasks. You assess whether responses are reasonable and demonstrate sound reasoning, not just exact matches.
```

### Judge prompt

```
You are evaluating a classification task for climate finance policy instruments.

Question: <QUESTION_DESCRIPTION, e.g. 'Categorize whether the instrument primarily targets the financial sector or the real economy'>

Ground Truth Answer: <GROUND_TRUTH_ANSWER>

Model Response: <MODEL_RESPONSE_BEING_EVALUATED>

Your task is to assess whether the model response is reasonable and in line with the thinking of the ground truth evaluator. In general, be lenient if the reasoning is sound as this is all ambiguous.
This is not just about exact matching - consider:

1. **Reasonableness**: Is the model's response a reasonable interpretation of the policy instrument given the classification criteria?
2. **Alignment with thinking**: Does the model's response demonstrate similar reasoning and categorization logic as the ground truth?
3. **Correctness**: Does the response capture the same essential classification/categorization as the ground truth?

CRITICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:

**Strict Adherence to Options**:
- The model response should only use categories, entities, market failures, and policy instruments that are in the classification schema
- If the response includes categories NOT in the provided list (e.g., "indigenous organizations", "non-profit organizations" when not listed), this is a significant issue
- However, note that "Public bodies" includes Indigenous organizations and governments

**Consistency of Terminology**:
- For Question 2, responses should use the EXACT category names from the schema consistently
- Do not accept responses that mix different phrasings for the same concept (e.g., alternating between "real economy mitigation" and "real economy decarbonization measures with a financial component")
- The ground truth uses specific terminology - the model should match that terminology, not use alternative phrasings

**Completeness**:
- For Question 5, responses must include BOTH the category AND the policy instrument (e.g., "Market-based: Concessional finance, subsidies and grants")
- If a response has the category but not the policy instrument, or vice versa, this is incomplete

**Question-Specific Considerations**:
- Question 2: Ensure consistent use of exact category names.
- Question 3: Verify all entities are from the provided list. The model should not add entities not in the schema
- Question 4: Consider that there are correlations - MIT measures often relate to externalities/public goods and concessional finance/subsidies/taxes. Market failures can be ambiguous, so be lenient if the reasoning is sound
- Question 5: Must include both category and policy instrument. Note that public investment in infrastructure counts as "Concessional finance, subsidies and grants" NOT "Market infrastructure"

Consider that:
- The response may use different wording but convey the same meaning (but prefer exact terminology matches)
- The response may be partially correct (e.g., identifies some but not all categories)
- Minor formatting differences are acceptable
- The core meaning, categories, and reasoning should align
- However, terminology consistency and strict adherence to provided options are important

Provide a nuanced score from 0.0 to 1.0 where:
- 1.0 = Perfect match or equivalent reasoning with correct terminology and complete response
- 0.8-0.9 = Very close, minor differences in wording or one missing element, but uses correct terminology
- 0.6-0.7 = Reasonable response that aligns with ground truth thinking but has some differences (terminology issues, missing elements, or going beyond options)
- 0.4-0.5 = Partially correct, shows some understanding but misses key elements or uses incorrect terminology
- 0.2-0.3 = Somewhat reasonable but significant differences from ground truth (wrong categories, incomplete, inconsistent)
- 0.0-0.1 = Incorrect or demonstrates different reasoning entirely

Format your response as JSON:
{"score": <float between 0.0 and 1.0>, "reasoning": "<detailed explanation addressing: (1) terminology consistency, (2) adherence to provided options, (3) completeness, (4) alignment with ground truth>"}
```

### Correction / second-opinion prompt (optional review step)

System prompt for this step:

```
You are an expert evaluator for climate finance classification tasks. Review responses critically using the full conversation context and provide constructive feedback.
```

User prompt:

```
You are an expert evaluator reviewing a classification response for a climate finance policy instrument.

You have access to the full conversation that led to this response. Here is the complete context:

SYSTEM PROMPT:
